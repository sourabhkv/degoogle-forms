## WHY DEGOOGLED FORMS ?
While Google forms is most used tool still it isn't good for many scenarios. Degoogled forms is **my take on what google forms can't.**<br>
### What Google forms **CAN'T**
- It is necessary to have internet to be able to use this tool.
- The design customization  is very limited. Advanced users can change the design to use the tool with a greater number of purposes.
- There are some security concerns. The user has to create a good password and protects it to increase the level of security.
- It accepts texts up to 500 Kb; images up to 2 Mb; and for spreadsheets the limit is 256 cells or 40 sheets.
- User can easily copy the question.
- Privacy concern since data is going through Google
- Data available in spreadsheet Only.
